## Oberon 2013 Modifications

Here you can find modifications (I deliberately do **not** call them *enhancements*) I did to Project Oberon 2013.


Unlike the Oberon modules [in the `OberonEmulator` repository](https://github.com/schierlm/OberonEmulator/tree/master/Oberon),
these modifications do not depend on my emulator and may be used on any emulator or even on bare metal.

Some modifications require recompiling the *inner core*, or even recompiling the bootloader,
but those requirements are clearly listed in the accompanying `README.md` file.

To recompile and link the inner core, you can use
[Andreas Pirklbauer's Boot Linker](https://github.com/andreaspirklbauer/Oberon-building-tools/blob/master/Sources/FPGAOberon2013/ORL.Mod),
which is (for convenience; it is impossible to use that repo as a submodule as it is frequently rebased) also available [in this repo](ORL.Mod.txt).

### Available modifications

Modifications marked with a † are not included in the prebuilt release. Either they collide with other modifications, they need
larger changes to the system which cannot be done by recompiling a few files and writing a new inner core, or they are not
designed to be used on a day-by-day basis.

The CommandLineCompiler is available as a separate release.

Modifications marked with a ‡ are only included in the prebuilt "debug release". These modifications aid in debugging, but have
a high performance or binary size overhead, and are therefore undesirable in normal builds.

There are also two separate releases available that include the rescue system (the normal one and the "debug" one).
